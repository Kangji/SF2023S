(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (weak_pumping)

    One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].  (For the sake of simplicity in this
    exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem than is usually
    stated in courses on automata theory -- hence the name
    [weak_pumping].)

    To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we
    are working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able
    to calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

Module Pumping.

  | EmptySet => 1

(** The (weak) pumping lemma itself says that, if [s =~ re] and if the
    length of [s] is at least the pumping constant of [re], then [s]
    can be split into three substrings [s1 ++ s2 ++ s3] in such a way
    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3], will still match [re].  Since [s2] is
    also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us
    a (constructive!) way to generate strings matching [re] that are
    as long as we like. *)

(** * Case Study: Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to
    relate boolean computations to statements in [Prop].  But
    performing this conversion as we did there can result in
    tedious proof scripts.  Consider the proof of the following
    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (n =? m) eqn:H.
    + (* n =? m = true *)
      intros _. rewrite eqb_eq in H. rewrite H.
      left. reflexivity.
    + (* n =? m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply
    the [eqb_eq] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [n =? m], to convert the assumption [n =? m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m]; then we had to [rewrite]
    using this assumption to complete the case. *)

(** We can streamline this sort of reasoning by defining an inductive
    proposition that yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =?
    m].  Instead of generating the assumption [(n =? m) = true], which
    usually requires some massaging before we can use it, this
    principle gives us right away the assumption we really need: [n =
    m].

    Following the terminology introduced in [Logic], we call this
    the "reflection principle for equality on numbers," and we say
    that the boolean [n =? m] is _reflected in_ the proposition [n =
    m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  It states that the property [P]
    _reflects_ (intuitively, is equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].

    To see this, notice that, by definition, the only way we can
    produce evidence for [reflect P true] is by showing [P] and then
    using the [ReflectT] constructor.  If we invert this statement,
    this means that we can extract evidence for [P] from a proof of
    [reflect P true].

    Similarly, the only way to show [reflect P false] is by tagging
    evidence for [~ P] with the [ReflectF] constructor. *)

(** To put this observation to work, we first prove that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.

(** We can think of [reflect] as a kind of variant of the usual "if
    and only if" connective; the advantage of [reflect] is that, by

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)

    Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    First define what it means for one list to be a merge of two
    others.  Do this with an inductive relation, not a [Fixpoint].  *)

(** Next, use [In] to define an inductive proposition [NoDup X

    represents the labels assigned to a list of items.  If there are

    label -- i.e., list [l1] must contain repeats.

    This proof is much easier if you use the [excluded_middle]
    hypothesis to show that [In] is decidable, i.e., [forall x l, (In x
    l) \/ ~ (In x l)].  However, it is also possible to make the proof

(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match automatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)
