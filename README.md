# Software Foundations

The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked:
the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Coq proof assistant.

## [Logical Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html)

Logical Foundations is the entry-point to the series.
It covers functional programming, basic concepts of logic,
computer-assisted theorem proving, and Coq.

## [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)

Programming Language Foundations surveys the theory of programming languages,
including operational semantics, Hoare logic, and static type systems.
